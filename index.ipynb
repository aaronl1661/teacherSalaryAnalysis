    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Faculty are the lifeblood of any university. They conduct cutting-edge research to discover new insights that push the boundary of the field they are studying. They also teach classes, helping students learn new skills and knowledge that will benefit them in their professional lives. As in any occupation, professors vary in the quality of their research and their teaching ability, which directly impacts the quality of education that students who take their classes receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students understand the fact that their choice of professor for a course can be the difference between an engaging, informative semester or a less than pleasing experience. Prior to registration, students often check professor reviews, online posts regarding the class, grade distributions, and other sources of information to determine whose class to choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to see the connection between how effective a professor is and possible determining factors of their teaching ability. Using data science, we will review salary data, years of experience, and average student rating of professors here at the University of Maryland to see how they correlate with their average Grade Point Average (GPA) for students across their classes. For example, does a professor with a high salary and many years of experience at UMD reflect in higher student GPAs? Once we build a correlative model, we can also pose performative questions in reverse, like whether the University is getting the best 'bang-for-their-buck' given a professor's salary and their average GPA as compared to other professors in the same field. \n",

    "### PlanetTerp\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking for information on a professor's grade distributions and student-made reviews of that professor, [PlanetTerp](https://planetterp.com/) was a natural place to look for the information we needed. The data there is specific to UMD and the website itself was made by students, who were generous enough to provide us a [documented API](https://planetterp.com/api/) that we could use. We used GET requests to the PlanetTerp API in order to get the information from the website, before storing it into dataframes. However, we quickly discovered that performing all of these requests could take excessive amounts of time. As such, we decided to store our data into csv files and then read from those files locally rather than constantly re-requesting the website. We did this by checking if our csv files already existed, and if they did we could simply read from those files, only requesting from the site if the csv files we were looking for didn't exist. As such, all of the data used from here on out in this tutorial will be accurate up until April 28th, 2023, as that is the last time we actually requested information from PlanetTerp itself. "

    "The other information that we need is a way to find out how much a teacher is earning, as well as a general estimate for how long they've been teaching at the University of Maryland. [The Diamondback](https://dbknews.com/) publishes a yearly [salary guide](https://salaryguide.dbknews.com/), which has its own [API](https://api.dbknews.com/docs/#/salary). From here, we were then able to perform the same process, using GET requests to read the salary data for each year from 2013 to 2022. This information not only tells us how much a certain professor got paid each year, but also allows us to deduct how long a professor has been working at UMD based on how many years they were getting paid. We also performed the same procedure of writing our data to csv files to read from locally, as all of these requests also took very long to perform. As such, like with PlanetTerp, the data used from here on out is accurate up until April 28th, 2023."

    "Eventually, we would like to have all of our data come together into one single dataframe for us to manipulate. Since student reviews and grades are currently being stored in separate dataframes, the first step towards our end goal is logically to combine these two dataframes into one, as they both come from the same data source. We would like to separate all of the data we currently have, grouping them by a specific course taught by a specific professor in a specific semester. The grade data from PlanetTerp is stored in this format, with each professor's classes being separated out into every semester they taught the class. However, the reviews left on the website don't have the semester that the student took the class in listed. As such, we have to make assumptions for what semester a student took the class they are reviewing based on the date that they left their review. We assume any review left from September to December are for fall classes, January are for winter classes, February to May are for spring classes, and June to August are for summer classes."
